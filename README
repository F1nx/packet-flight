Packet Flight: visualizing packets

Packet Flight is a script that turns a TCP packet dump (tcpdump) data into a
Processing animation.

At the moment this is a very basic demonstraion of the idea.

TODOS:

  * take any valid TCP dump

  * generate & compile the progam in one step (no copy/paste into Processing)

  * automatically figure out the latency and correct the timings to account
    for it. The dump timestamps show the send time of sent packets and the
    recieved time of recieved packets, so the timings for recieved packets
    have to be adjusted backwards.

  * show labels for nodes and packets

  * prettier visualizations

  * sound effects!

  * a timeline for pausing, skipping, etc.
