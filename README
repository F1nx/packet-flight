Packet Flight: visualizing packets

Packet Flight is a script that turns a TCP packet dump (tcpdump) data into a
Processing animation.

At the moment this is a very basic demonstraion of the idea.

On linux (ubuntu) to generate a dump use the following command

sudo tcpdump -n -i <INTERFACE> -tt host <HOST>  > data.tcp

and after to generate the correct data file for the viewer 

./build.sh <DATA_PATH>

finally to visualize it simply open the viewer.html file


TODOS:

  * automatically figure out the latency and correct the timings to account
    for it. The dump timestamps show the send time of sent packets and the
    received time of received packets, so the timings for received packets
    have to be adjusted backwards.

  * show labels for nodes and packets

  * prettier visualizations

  * sound effects!

  * a timeline for pausing, skipping, etc.
