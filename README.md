# packet-airport
A forked improvement of `aristus/packet-flight`.


What is it?
-
Packet Flight is a script that turns a TCP packet dump (tcpdump) data into an animation.

*Why not have this directly forked?* Because the original author would likely want to keep the language `Processing` included. Another reason that goes with this is that the project can gain more attention by being searchable.

If you notice, in comparison to the original repository, that this fork does not include `Processing`. This is because upon running it, the libraries imported are not default to the language. In addition, using JavaScript and Python is more compatible and user friendly.


Usage
-
Just run `start.py`!
